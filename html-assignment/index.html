                I am an Iranian Turkmen who had lived in Turkey since 1<sup>st</sup> month of 2008. I got my bachelor's
                degree in architecture from <abbr title="Middle East Technical University">METU</abbr> in Ankara/Turkey.
                My experience in architecture made me realize that I have more interest in a combination of programming,
                design, and graphics. That is why I decided to enroll in the Interactive Media Design program.

                It's my first semester and I am new in Ottawa. Education for me is all about learning and figuring out
                what I want to do in life the most. And the digital world has been giving us that chance to get creative
                results faster than we used to. I am a hardworking individual who loves to learn and experience new
                things. That's the reason I came to Canada and Enrolling in such an interdisciplinary program.
